                <h3>1.1 You provide relevant personal information to PikaBoo Studio</h3>
                <p>To play the games provided by PikaBoo Studio and use various services, you can choose to create an
                    account
                    using your Facebook, Google, Apple ID accounts or through Quick login.</p>
                <h4>1.1.3 Login mode:</h4>
                <p>If you choose to log in using your Facebook, Google, or Apple ID accounts, you need to share your
                    corresponding account details (including your account number and avatar). The above account is used
                    only to help us identify and verify your identity. This also helps PikaBoo Studio pair your account
                    number
                    to the game account number, thereby realizing synchronization of the game data under the account
                    between different devices, so as to avoid the loss of game data such as level and items, and protect
                    the security of your account.</p>
